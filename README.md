# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

## Goal / Background

This project is to serve as a fun little entry way to reinforcement learning and to build my background to help with the (sjlist/pokemon-sim project)[https://github.com/sjlist/pokemon-sim]. 

The project has multiple stages and will be changing form as I learn more. Initially, I'm focusing on building a tic-tac-toe game in C++ using the command line and standard libraries. This game is chosen because it's a simple two player, turn-based game that I can code up in an afternoon (thus refreshing my C++, which is admittedly rusty at this point). 

The end goal of this project is to train an algorithm to play tic-tac-toe better than randomly guessing. I have a low bar here because I really only care about learning the tools. 


## Run

Cmake is set up for this project. Build it with `cmake .` followed by `make` and then run the executable `tictactapp` produced. 

## Tools

The game will be built with C++ and standard libraries and the algorithm will be built and trained in Julia 1.1.1. This is because I like the language and am eager to learn it better. Additionally, it seems to have very good C++ integration and speed. 

These tools are subject to change as I continue the project.
